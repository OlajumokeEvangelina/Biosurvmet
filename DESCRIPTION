Description: An approach to identifies metabolic biomarker signature for metabolic data by discovering predictive metabolite for predicting survival and classifying patients into risk groups. 
 Classifiers are constructed as a linear combination of predictive/important metabolites, prognostic factors and treatment effects if necessary. Several methods were implemented to obtain 
 the classifiers along with various validation procedures such as majority votes technique, LASSO, Elastic net based classifiers and as function of the first Principle component analysis scores or Partial least scores.
 Sensitivity analysis on the quantile used for the classification can be accessed to check the deviation of the classification group based on the quantile specified. Large scale cross validation can be performed in 
 order to investigate the mostly selected predictive metabolites and for internal validation. During the evaluation process, validation is accessed using the hazard ratios (HR) distribution of the test set Inference is mainly based on resampling methods and permutations technique.
